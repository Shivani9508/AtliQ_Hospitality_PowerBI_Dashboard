# AtliQ_Hospitality_PowerBI_Dashboard

Problem Statement : 🧐 
AtliQ Grands, renowned for its five-star hotels across India, has been a stalwart in the hospitality industry for two decades. However, recent strategic maneuvers by competitors and ineffective decision-making within management have led to a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury business category. Consequently, the company has opted to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" to reclaim its market share and bolster revenue streams.

Task :
My task is to offer comprehensive insights into their past three months of business operations, enabling crucial decision-making and facilitating the recovery of losses in the industry.

🚧 
In the project, I took on specific tasks that broadened my exploration beyond initial ideas. I used Power BI to import datasets, performing data cleaning and generating crucial measures and columns.

👇 I collected key insights to aid in revitalising their market share in the business.
✨  As from the revenue part Mumbai is topping the chart with (668M )of Revenue followed by Bangalore (420 M), Delhi (294M) & Hyderabad at (325M) of revenue in # months of data.
✨  Taking a look at least occupancy % which shows Atliq Grand, Bangalore has the lowest with an average of 2.36 of customer rating.
✨ Booking from logtrip has made the successful checked out and highest booking with 70.59%.
✨ Direct offline booking contributing to 70.20% which is a commendable factors also it highlights that other platforms need to be worked out for better growth and performance in the market.
✨ Majority of revenue is coming from Luxury category which is around 62% of contribution.
✨ There is slight difference in ADR (Average daily rate) generated on weekdays and weekends, which indicates that hotels are not looking over their pricing strategy. It should be seen upon to generate more revenue, as the price factor in this industry is very elastic and changes heavily in weekends and weekdays.

My Learning 🔍 
📕 I learned about the operational dynamics of the hospitality industry as a commercial entity within the market.
📕 Significant decisions can be derived from analysing market trends during weekdays and weekends.
📕 Acquired understanding of RevPar, ADR, DURN, DSRN, and various other business terminology prevalent in the hospitality industry.
